 - Use them and save the template as a file to .circleci/config.yml in your root repo.
 - You can also copy paste the template directly into your configuration file editor in CircleCI
 - Note the templates only have node dependencies for scanning goof (nodejs-goof) project as found here - https://github.com/snyk-labs/nodejs-goof
 - Please modify if you would like to scan other Snyk-lab projects.
